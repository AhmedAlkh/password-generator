## Description
1. User clicks the red "Generate Password" button to begin.
2. User is prompted to select the password length. Length must be between 8 to 128 characters. If password length is too short or long, user cannot continue and is prompted to try again.
3. User is prompted to select password criteria (lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, special characters). If user decides to use or not to use a character type, they are alerted that their password WILL or WILL NOT contain that character type. User must select at least one character type or they cannot continue and are alerted to select atleast one character type.
4. Password consisting of the length and criteria selected by the user is randomly generated and sent to the web page's main text box. It can now be copied and pasted!
